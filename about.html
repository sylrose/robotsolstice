        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>micha</strong> or <strong>heliomie</strong> online (´♡‿♡`). I'm a pirate / bookkeeper / anarchist / bard / violinist / poet / hauntologer / siphonophore who does web things...maybe. I love anime and idol girls and YURI (✧∀✧)/ I have a really cool and interesting life that everyone should read this comic about. Sorry it's not scifi... we can't all live in a science fiction world (as much as I wish I did)...and this is nonfiction.</p>

            <p>So, what's this comic about, I'm sure you're wondering... ("get to the point lady!!!!!") Unfortunately, you've come to the wrong place. I don't know either (╬ Ò﹏Ó) It's ok though. It is an assortment of invigorating things that happen in my life, featuring <a href="characters.html">ME!!!</a>. Robot Solstice also features things about my evil daughters, <a href="characters.html">Miré</a> and <a href="characters.html">Camie</a>... if I get around to making stuff about them.</p>
            <p>The picture on the right side is me. The picture on the left side is an illusion that carries the cartoonish soul of who I am through the "IRL" realm. </p>
            <p> Anyways, I made this comic because I was bored in the period shortly before I begin my junior year of high school.  Goodbye!! Or see you soon...(>ᴗ•)</p>
